- Intro slide
- Hello, World Example
    - Explain:
        - `fn` declaration
        - `println` is a macro
    - Format strings in `println!`
        - `println("Hello, {}!", world);`
        - also show `{:?}`
    - Move "world" into a local variable so we can change it
        - `let name = "Rustacean"; println("Hello, {}!", name);`
    - Abstract into a helper fn
        - `fn greet(name: String) { println("Hello, {}!", name); }`
        - What goes wrong?
            - Explain `format!`, show how you can use same helpers
            - Explain `push_str` and mutable local variables
                - `let mut name = format!("fellow "); name.push_str("Rustacean");`
    - Call helper fn twice
        - What goes wrong now?
- Ownership slides
- Borrowing slides
- Borrowing example
    - Show that `&` and `&mut` cannot overlap
    - Time-limited
- For loops
  - show that `s` has type `String`
